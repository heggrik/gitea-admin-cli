# Gitea-Admin-Cli

## The plan

I hate doing admin-stuff through a web-gui, especially when you need to do a million clicks to acheive something. That is why i'm building this application.
Through the use of Gitea's APIs this app intends to have everything in a neat package, with everything within reach. 

I'm also using this project to learn Golang, so bear with me. 

So, if you just like me hate clicking around gui's this is for you. 

## Execution

I am nowhere near to being done, i do have a simple POC that works. But there is still a long way to go.
